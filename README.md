# Arduino_Seismometer
NERdaq is a data acquisition system developed at New England Research to support slinky-based seismometers in schools. 
(Google "bsu seismic network" for links.) 
The daq is built around an arduino and streams 16-bit (oversampled) values to a usb port; the data are sampled at about 18.78 samples/second.
Circuit details, pcb info, and arduino codes are provided for unrestricted use.

The Arduino code files are also available at http://ru.auckland.ac.nz/files/2014/07/nerdaqII.zip.
